# N-Queen-Problem
N-Queens Solver in Java This project implements the N-Queens problem using backtracking in Java. It allows users to input the board size (N) and finds a valid arrangement of N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard, ensuring that no two queens attack each other. If a solution exists, it prints the board; otherwise, it notifies the user.
